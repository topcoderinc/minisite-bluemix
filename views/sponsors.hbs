          <h1>Sponsors</h1>
          <p>We’d like to thank our primary IBM sponsors. Together, we built real apps for real customers across IBM. None of this was possible without our awesome sponsors who embraced the Spring into Bluemix program and Topcoder with curiosity, passion, and a desire to create powerful applications.</p>

        <h2>IBM ifundIT</h2>
        <p class="text-small">IBM ifundIT is IBM's enterprise crowdfunding program that is being used to drive innovation inside the company. IBM employees around the world are making an impact by funding the creation of apps that make work easier -- from finding people who are socially influential, to analyzing how big an impact your internal app is having on fellow employees.</p>
        <p class="text-small">With 35+ projects run in parallel since December 2014 - mostly front end design - over 12 apps have come out of ifundIT so far, such as Lock Your Laptop, Play IBM, Park Up, IBM Classifieds, Learn and Earn and Quarter End Journey, which have been positively received.  With the Appirio Community as ifundIT's primary development channel in 2015, the Spring into Bluemix campaign will also be underway soon, with 30 apps completed in a turn around time of just 60 days each.</p>
